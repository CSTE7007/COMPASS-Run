The following regions are excluded from the CNV inference because their coverage is too low: GATA2,NPM1,JAK2,SRSF2,chr18,
Starting 4 MCMC chains in parallel
Chain 3: Starting first phase (finding the best tree without CNV).
Chain 0: Starting first phase (finding the best tree without CNV).
Chain 1: Starting first phase (finding the best tree without CNV).
Chain 2: Starting first phase (finding the best tree without CNV).
Chain 2: After the first phase (inferring the best tree without CNVs), COMPASS identified the following candidate regions which might contain CNVs: EZH2,WT1,TP53,
Chain 2: Starting second phase (finding the best tree with CNV).
Chain 0: After the first phase (inferring the best tree without CNVs), COMPASS identified the following candidate regions which might contain CNVs: EZH2,WT1,TP53,
Chain 0: Starting second phase (finding the best tree with CNV).
Chain 3: After the first phase (inferring the best tree without CNVs), COMPASS identified the following candidate regions which might contain CNVs: EZH2,WT1,TP53,
